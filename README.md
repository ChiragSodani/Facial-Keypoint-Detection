# Facial_Keypoint_Detection

This Project was done as a part CS-574 (Computer Vision using Machine Learning) course at IIT Guwahati.

## Dependencies
1. Numpy
2. Python 3.6
3. Keras(with Theano Backend)
4. Pandas
5. Scikit-Learn

## Architectures 
We have tried out 4 kinds of Architecture namely :
1) RandomForest
   * Data was split into 33% test data and 77% training data.
   * RMSE = 2.02725802
2) Feed-Forward Neural Network (with single hidden layer of 100 Neuron)
   * Data was split into 33% test data and 77% training data.
   * RMSE = 2.71529003976
   * Some result on test data:
