# Facial_Keypoint_Detection

This Project was done as a part CS-574 (Computer Vision using Machine Learning) course at IIT Guwahati.

## Dependencies
1. Numpy
2. Python 3.6
3. Keras(with Theano Backend)
4. Pandas

We have tried out 4 kinds of Architecture namely :
1) RandomForest
2) Feed-Forward Neural Network (with single hidden layer of 100 Neuron)
3) Convolutional Neural Network 
4) Convolutional Neural Network (with dropout on every layer)
